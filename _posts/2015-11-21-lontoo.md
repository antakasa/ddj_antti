### The difference between average prices of rooms to rent and average budget of potential roomseekers might be hundreds of pounds in certain parts of London. 

Where is it afforable to live in the city? What are the most wanted areas by room seekers? In which parts of London the ratio of available rooms to room hunters is most favourable to find a place to live?
