Hello.

I am a Finnish masters student stuydying currently in Erasmus Mundus Masters in Journalism. 

This is a portfolio compiled for London City University's course "Introduction to Data Journalism". The stories introduced here are written solely for the course's purposes. The main aim was to learn some technical skills required to produce advanced data-driven stories from the scratch.
